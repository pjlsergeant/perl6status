        <h2>What is the current status of Perl 6?</h2>

<p><strong>Quick answer:</strong> there's a usable alpha, ready to download and use right now.</p>

<p><strong>Longer answer:</strong></p>

<p>Perl 6 is a language specification. There is an implementation of it called <em>Rakudo</em>,
and a distribution of <em>Rakudo</em> called <em>Rakudo Star</em>.</p>

<p>Rakudo Star feels a lot like an alpha of Perl 6. You can compile programs written
in Perl 6, use modules written in Perl 6 (a selection of which are bundled with it),
and you can do that <strong>today</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're a Perl 5 user, you might be asking: "Can [the implementation of Perl 6 called
Rakudo Star] do everything that <code>/usr/bin/perl5</code> can today?" The answer is "mostly, yes".
Rakudo Star misses a few Unicode features Perl 5 has and doesn't have non-blocking IO
across all its backends. In the unlikely event you've ever used
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlform.html">Perl formats</a>, they're missing too.</p>

<p>Other than that, the "not quite done" parts are things <code>/usr/bin/perl5</code> can't do right now:
advanced macros, threads and concurrency, specialist data-types for people working with
large numeric data sets, and a few other bits and pieces. Additionally, performance and
stability have the characteristics of an alpha.</p>

<p>But it has all the rest of the cool stuff you were promised, <strong>already</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="http://perlcabal.org/syn/S12.html#Classes">rich OO model</a>
with mixins, compositions, parametric roles, all sorts of fun stuff</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6_rules">Grammar-inspired regular expressions</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_6#Junctions">Junctions</a>, which are composite values</p></li>
<li><p>And almost everything else you'd want from an alpha of a new dynamic language...</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most of the current work on "Perl 6" is in fixing bugs, performance, and stability of
the pieces that makes up the Rakudo Star distribution rather than adding new features.</p>

<h2>Where can I see some examples of Perl 6?</h2>

<p><strong>Modules</strong></p>

<p>One of Perl's strengths has always been CPAN. Perl 6 doesn't have a rich CPAN
infrastructure yet, but <a href="http://modules.perl6.org/">a list of Perl 6 modules is available</a></p>

<p>Some quick links:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/cosimo/perl6-digest-md5/blob/master/lib/Digest/MD5.pm">MD5 implementation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/retupmoca/p6-Email-Simple/blob/master/lib/Email/Simple/Header.pm6">Email header parsing</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/tadzik/File-Find/blob/master/lib/File/Find.pm">File::Find implementation</a></p></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Rosetta Code</strong></p>

<p>Rosetta Code shows how many different programming tasks are accomplished in many different
languages. Over 700 Perl 6 examples are linked to from
<a href="http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Perl_6">the Perl 6 category</a></p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>

<p>Many examples are linked to from the <a href="http://perl6.org/documentation/">official Perl 6 documentation</a></p>

<h2>Tell me something cool about "recent" Perl 6 developments!</h2>

<p>Rakudo has a JVM backend! That's cool, right?</p>

<h2>Where can I learn Perl 6?</h2>

<p>There are a number of tutorials and code examples at the
<a href="http://perl6.org/documentation/">official Perl 6 documentation</a></p>

<h2>What has happened with Perl 6 recently, and what's next?</h2>
